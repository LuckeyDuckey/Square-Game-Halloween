# Square-Game-Halloween
A small Halloween themed game made using pygame. this was completed in a short amount of time so the code is messy in some areas however its functional. there was also a planned multiplayer feature but i didnt manage to get it finished before halloween which is when i planned to release the game and i moved on to other projects after as there was not much intrest in the game anyway.
